Create a youtube jukebox.

Queue of youtube videos on website.
	Allow users to choose songs and put them into the queue.
	This queue gets written to a file.

On "server"
	Something takes url's from file and plays them through speakers.
	Possibly java, but that might get nasty.  Also, possibly a python script?
